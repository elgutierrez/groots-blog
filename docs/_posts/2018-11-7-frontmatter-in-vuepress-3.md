summary: An initial step into the grower path

In nature, the Cannabis plant cycle goes from seedling in spring to vegetative growth in summer to flowering in fall. It takes from 3 to 6 months and can be replicated indoors, regardless of seasons, with proper control of environmental factors, such as exposure to light, humidity and temperature.

In this initial topic, we will cover the basics of the plant life cycle and what are the main concerns in order to get a good harvest.

So now that you have your little seeds in hand, you want to get started!

You could as well take a cutting from another plant and create a clone from it. It is a fun process that will be covered in a specific post.

First thing is you have to **make the seeds germinate**. It is possible and also a good tip to start germination before planting them. All it takes is: humidity, air circulation and heat (room temperature).

You can put them in a water soaked paper towel, fold it and keep it in a saucer, to preserve humidity. That’s the process of the seed cracking and allowing the root to come out. It can take between 3 and 10 days to trigger it. Check them at least once a day to make sure the paper towel is still moist. If not, add water. Without enough humidity, it can make the process longer or even kill the seed in extreme cases. Once that’s done, you plant them into small pots or in rock wool cubes. If you're going directly to the pot, plant the seed no deeper then 1 cm or 0,5 inches. The soil should not be too compact, so as to give room for the roots to spread.

The germination phase is the one that requires the most humidity in the life cycle, ideally around 60-70%. “Do I need a hygrometer?” If you’re just getting started, it will be fine as long as you don’t let it dry out, but if you aim for precision, get your hygrometer and be happy! Don’t let it drown either. Poor water gently just until the point that the paper towel is soaked, but no further. Plant it in a pot with draining holes in the bottom. In a few days you will see the little guy poking out.

Make sure the plant has a lot of light exposure. If by germination time you have long sunny days where you live, and you can manage to have it under the sun all day long, perfect. check in the app how is your sun exposure based on your geolocation. 

If you need artificial lighting, get yourself a powerful lamp. If you bought our starter’s kit, you're good. Otherwise, you can do just as fine with one of these inexpensive options:

* Compact Fluorescent Lamp (CFL) of at least 125W - more energy-efficient
* High Intensity Discharge (HID) lamp of 150W to 250W - better for plant growth, but higher in energy consumption
* LED lights, which are more expensive to buy but cheaper on your energy bill - these are more tricky and we'll have a dedicated blog post to compare it to the other too.

Germination and vegetative phases require a lot of light everyday. To cover both periods, you can set your timer (this one you really need) to at least 16h/day with the lights on. To trigger the flowering phase, switch to 12on/12off when the time comes, and the plant will understand it’s time for some flowers (magical, is it not?).

If you’re a gardener AND a poet, gradually reduce the exposure hours week by week until you get to 12/12, as if it was the fall season approaching. Naturally, there will be a dedicated post on how to trigger the flowering phase.

Now you have your plant growing gloriously everyday. At some point you might need to put it in a bigger pot to allow it to keep growing. Same rule goes as with any other plant. If you start to see the roots coming out of the draining holes, it means more space is needed. Find her a bigger pot and she will be fine!
